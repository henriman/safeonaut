An app to make drug use safer.

## Motivation

Regardless of your opinion on drugs and drug use, the reality is that **people use drugs**.

The goal of this app is to make this as safe as possible, given the legal circumstances
(i. e., mostly prohibition) around the world. My goal is not to encourage anyone
to try any legal or illegal substances, but rather to promote responsible use.

To achieve this, this app includes (or will include) various tools to aid users in
testing their drugs, and informing themselves about the substances they want to take.

## Features

At the moment, this app only implements one feature: aiding drug testing using reagent kits.
**Note: this feature is not fully implemented yet and the information already provided not 
necessarily accurate. Do not yet rely on the results the app returns.**

### Drug reagent testing

With illegal drugs you can never be sure that what you bought is actually what you think it is. 
It could be cut with other substances, or be another drug entirely. In order to be able to 
appropriately measure dosages and to know what to expect from the experience, however, you have 
to be sure what drug you are taking.

Drug reagent kits can help here. The reagents are chemicals, which upon coming in contact with
the substance will start a colorful reaction; the color changes occuring during these reactions
vary from drug to drug and thus can point to what the substance actually is. Usually you have to
test your substance with various reagents in order to be reasonably sure about what you are taking.

These tests of course not as thorough as professional laboratory tests, and can also not
measure the potency of the substance at hand. However, a drug reagent test is a viable alternative
in places where such laboratory tests are not possible, or when a user does not have the patience 
to wait on the results etc.; in these situations, these tests can at least give a user some
level of confidence in knowing what they are taking.

Usually, when you conduct a test, you have to compare the color changes occuring to a table
of substances and their reactions to the reagent. Often, some substances share the same reaction 
to one reagent, so you have to test with several of them in order to narrow down your results.

This is where the app comes in. By taking the user by the hand through conducting a test,
giving them detailed instructions on what to do exactly and automatically determining the result
of several tests, it tries to make the whole process as easy and foolproof as possible.

### Other feature ideas

- A wiki providing basic information about each drug (such as dosage, duration, effects) as well as
links to further, more detailed resources.
- A tool which gives information about what effects mixing different substances has.
- Emergency actions: calling an emergency contact or an ambulance, or playing calming music.
- A log of the drug and their dosages a user has taken.
- The ability to "record" experiences, i. e. specifying what amount of what substance you have taken,
when you have taken it, reminders to drink water, adding voice recordings / text in which you describe 
your experience etc. This information could then be used to ease the writing and publishing of a trip 
report, in order to add to the knowledge base we have about these drugs.
